# Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)

## What Is GKE?

> **GKE** is a fully managed Kubernetes service hosted on Google's infrastructure, designed to deploy, manage, and scale Kubernetes environments for containerized applications.

- **Fully managed** — no need to provision underlying resources
- Uses a **container-optimized OS** maintained by Google, optimized to scale quickly with a minimal resource footprint

---

## GKE Autopilot

- A mode of operation that manages your **cluster configuration automatically**
- Covers: nodes, scaling, security, and other preconfigured settings
- Less operational overhead compared to Standard mode

## Core GKE Features

| Feature                 | Detail                                                                                |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Cluster**             | The Kubernetes system GKE creates and sets up for you                                 |
| **Auto-upgrade**        | Clusters are always upgraded to the latest stable version of Kubernetes automatically |
| **Nodes**               | VMs that host containers within a GKE cluster                                         |
| **Node auto-repair**    | Periodic health checks on each node; unhealthy nodes are drained and recreated        |
| **Cluster autoscaling** | GKE can scale the cluster itself, not just the workloads running on it                |

## GKE Integrations

| Service                             | Role in GKE                                                                      |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Cloud Build + Artifact Registry** | Automates deployment using private container images stored securely              |
| **IAM**                             | Controls access via accounts and role permissions                                |
| **Google Cloud Observability**      | Provides insight into application performance                                    |
| **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)**     | Supplies network infrastructure including load balancers and ingress access      |
| **Google Cloud Console**            | Dashboard for viewing, inspecting, and deleting GKE clusters and their resources |

## Google Cloud Console vs. Open-Source Kubernetes Dashboard

- Open-source Kubernetes provides a dashboard, but it requires **significant effort to set up securely**
- The **Google Cloud Console** offers a more powerful, managed dashboard for GKE clusters and workloads — no setup or management required

## ACE Exam-Style Practice Questions

### Q1
In a Gke Overview cluster, one microservice is CPU-heavy while others are general purpose. How should you optimize?

A. Keep one node pool and only increase pod priority
B. Create dedicated compute-optimized node pool for CPU-heavy workload and keep general-purpose pool for others
C. Disable autoscaling
D. Move workload to Cloud Storage

Answer: B
Trap: Node pools allow workload-specific machine-family optimization.

### Q2
A Gke Overview deployment must be updated with minimal downtime. Which command pattern is best?

A. Delete and recreate service and deployment
B. kubectl set image deployment/NAME CONTAINER=NEW_IMAGE
C. Restart all cluster nodes
D. Create a new project for each version

Answer: B
Trap: Rolling image update is safer and faster than destructive redeploy patterns.

### Think Like a Google Engineer
- Primary optimization axis: Elastic performance with minimum operational toil.
- Start with constraints first: SLO, security, compliance, latency, budget, and team operations capacity.
- Prefer managed services if they satisfy requirements with lower long-term operational toil.
- Minimize blast radius using environment isolation, least privilege, and failure-domain awareness.
- Design for day-2 operations: observability, rollback strategy, and quota or budget guardrails.

### Most Correct Option Filter (60 Seconds)
1. Eliminate options with broad access, single points of failure, or missing monitoring.
2. Confirm the option meets non-negotiables first: security and reliability requirements.
3. Compare remaining options on operational simplicity and long-term maintainability.
4. Use cost as an optimizer only after requirements and risk controls are satisfied.

### Weighted Decision Matrix
| Dimension | Weight | Strong Signal |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Security | 3 | Least privilege, secure defaults, no exposed blast radius |
| Reliability | 3 | Multi-zone or HA design, health checks, tested recovery path |
| Operability | 2 | Clear monitoring, alerting, rollout and rollback simplicity |
| Cost Efficiency | 2 | Right-sized resources, no waste, no reliability regression |
| Performance | 1 | Meets latency and throughput targets with headroom |

### Real-Life Scenario
A media startup has unpredictable traffic spikes during launches. They need faster releases, automatic scaling, and strong reliability without overpaying for idle capacity.

### Worked Example
- Choose managed compute first when operations overhead is a concern.
- For VM workloads, use managed instance groups with autoscaling and autohealing.
- For container workloads, use GKE node pools and rolling updates.
- For event-driven workloads, prefer Cloud Run or functions with concurrency controls.
