# Choosing the Right Hybrid Connectivity Option

## Interconnect vs. Peering

| Category         | Services                                                               | IP Access               | SLA |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- | --- |
| **Interconnect** | Dedicated Interconnect, Partner Interconnect, Cross-Cloud Interconnect | RFC 1918 (internal IPs) | Yes |
| **Peering**      | Direct Peering, Carrier Peering                                        | Public IPs only         | No  |

---

## Decision Flow

### 1. Do you need access to Workspace, YouTube, or Google Cloud APIs?

- **Yes** → Use a **Peering** service
  - Can meet Google's Direct Peering requirements? → **Direct Peering**
  - Cannot meet requirements? → **Carrier Peering**

### 2. Do you need to connect GCP to another cloud provider?

- **Yes, high bandwidth + Google-managed routing** → **Cross-Cloud Interconnect**
- **Yes, no high bandwidth + want Google-managed encryption** → **Cloud VPN**

### 3. Do you want to extend your on-premises network to Google Cloud (Interconnect)?

**Can you meet Google at a colocation facility?**

**No →**

- Modest bandwidth, short-term/trial, need encryption → **Cloud VPN**
- Otherwise → **Partner Interconnect**
  - Need BGP peering → **L2 Partner Interconnect**
  - Don't need BGP peering → **L3 Partner Interconnect**

**Yes →** Consider **Dedicated Interconnect**, but switch to **Cloud VPN or Partner Interconnect** if:

- You cannot provide your own encryption for sensitive traffic
- 10 Gbps is more than you need
- You need access to multiple cloud services

After choosing an Interconnect option:

- **Want Google-managed encryption?** → Use **Cloud VPN over Interconnect**

## ACE Exam-Style Practice Questions

### Q1
For Choosing Hybrid Connectivity, you need highly available hybrid connectivity with dynamic route exchange. What should you choose?

A. HA VPN with Cloud Router
B. Static routes only over one tunnel
C. Cloud NAT only
D. Cloud CDN

Answer: A
Trap: Dynamic routing and high availability requirements usually indicate HA VPN plus BGP.

### Q2
In a Choosing Hybrid Connectivity design, multiple projects in one org need centralized networking administration. What is best?

A. Shared VPC
B. Separate isolated VPCs with no governance
C. One service account for every project owner
D. DNS forwarding only

Answer: A
Trap: Shared VPC centralizes subnet and firewall control across service projects.

### Think Like a Google Engineer
- Primary optimization axis: Latency-resilience balance with private-by-default connectivity.
- Start with constraints first: SLO, security, compliance, latency, budget, and team operations capacity.
- Prefer managed services if they satisfy requirements with lower long-term operational toil.
- Minimize blast radius using environment isolation, least privilege, and failure-domain awareness.
- Design for day-2 operations: observability, rollback strategy, and quota or budget guardrails.

### Most Correct Option Filter (60 Seconds)
1. Eliminate options with broad access, single points of failure, or missing monitoring.
2. Confirm the option meets non-negotiables first: security and reliability requirements.
3. Compare remaining options on operational simplicity and long-term maintainability.
4. Use cost as an optimizer only after requirements and risk controls are satisfied.

### Weighted Decision Matrix
| Dimension | Weight | Strong Signal |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Security | 3 | Least privilege, secure defaults, no exposed blast radius |
| Reliability | 3 | Multi-zone or HA design, health checks, tested recovery path |
| Operability | 2 | Clear monitoring, alerting, rollout and rollback simplicity |
| Cost Efficiency | 2 | Right-sized resources, no waste, no reliability regression |
| Performance | 1 | Meets latency and throughput targets with headroom |

### Real-Life Scenario
An ecommerce platform serves customers across regions. The team must keep latency low, protect internal services, and survive zonal failures while controlling egress costs.

### Worked Example
- Place internet-facing services behind the correct external load balancer type.
- Keep internal services private with internal load balancers and private IP ranges.
- Use firewall rules by tags or service accounts, not wide open CIDR ranges.
- Add Cloud CDN or regional placement based on traffic profile and content type.
