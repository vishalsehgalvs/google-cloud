# ⚖️ Cloud Load Balancing

## What is Load Balancing?

A **load balancer** distributes user traffic across multiple instances of an application.

- Spreads the load → reduces risk of performance issues.
- Cloud Load Balancing is **fully distributed, software-defined, and managed** — no VMs to manage yourself.
- No scaling or managing of the load balancers needed.
- **No pre-warming required** — handles sudden traffic spikes automatically (e.g. a game launch).

### What traffic it supports

- HTTP / HTTPS
- TCP and SSL
- UDP

### Key capabilities

- **Cross-region load balancing** — spreads traffic across multiple regions.
- **Automatic multi-region failover** — gradually shifts traffic away from unhealthy backends.
- Reacts quickly to changes in: users, traffic, network conditions, and backend health.

---

## Types of Load Balancers

Google Cloud load balancers are classified by which **OSI layer** they operate at.

---

### Application Load Balancers (Layer 7 — Application Layer)

- Handle **HTTP and HTTPS** traffic.
- Ideal for web apps needing advanced features:
  - **Content-based routing** — route traffic based on URL, headers, etc.
  - **SSL/TLS termination**
- Operate as **reverse proxies** — incoming traffic hits the load balancer, which then forwards to backends based on your rules.
- Available for both **external** (internet-facing) and **internal** applications.

---

### Network Load Balancers (Layer 4 — Transport Layer)

- Handle **TCP, UDP, and other IP protocols**.
- Two sub-types:

| Type                                  | How it works                                                                       | Best for                                                           |
| ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Proxy Network Load Balancer**       | Acts as a reverse proxy — terminates client connections, opens new ones to backend | Advanced traffic management; backends on-premises or multi-cloud   |
| **Passthrough Network Load Balancer** | Does NOT modify or terminate connections — forwards traffic directly to backend    | Apps needing direct server return or a wider range of IP protocols |

> Key difference: Passthrough preserves the **original source IP address**; Proxy does not.

### Think Like a Google Engineer
- Primary optimization axis: Latency-resilience balance with private-by-default connectivity.
- Start with constraints first: SLO, security, compliance, latency, budget, and team operations capacity.
- Prefer managed services if they satisfy requirements with lower long-term operational toil.
- Minimize blast radius using environment isolation, least privilege, and failure-domain awareness.
- Design for day-2 operations: observability, rollback strategy, and quota or budget guardrails.

### Most Correct Option Filter (60 Seconds)
1. Eliminate options with broad access, single points of failure, or missing monitoring.
2. Confirm the option meets non-negotiables first: security and reliability requirements.
3. Compare remaining options on operational simplicity and long-term maintainability.
4. Use cost as an optimizer only after requirements and risk controls are satisfied.

### Weighted Decision Matrix
| Dimension | Weight | Strong Signal |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Security | 3 | Least privilege, secure defaults, no exposed blast radius |
| Reliability | 3 | Multi-zone or HA design, health checks, tested recovery path |
| Operability | 2 | Clear monitoring, alerting, rollout and rollback simplicity |
| Cost Efficiency | 2 | Right-sized resources, no waste, no reliability regression |
| Performance | 1 | Meets latency and throughput targets with headroom |

### Real-Life Scenario
An ecommerce platform serves customers across regions. The team must keep latency low, protect internal services, and survive zonal failures while controlling egress costs.

### Worked Example
- Place internet-facing services behind the correct external load balancer type.
- Keep internal services private with internal load balancers and private IP ranges.
- Use firewall rules by tags or service accounts, not wide open CIDR ranges.
- Add Cloud CDN or regional placement based on traffic profile and content type.

### Fast Recall
- Pick load balancer type by traffic pattern, not preference.
- Private services should stay private end to end.
- Health checks and multi-zone design are core reliability controls.
