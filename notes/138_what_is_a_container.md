# What Is a Container?

## Evolution of Application Deployment

### Era 1 — Physical Servers

- Apps ran on dedicated local computers
- Required physical space, power, cooling, and network connectivity
- Install OS → install dependencies → install app
- Each machine typically had **one purpose** (database, web server, CDN)
- Wasted resources; slow to deploy, maintain, and scale

---

### Era 2 — Virtualization

- **Virtualization** = creating a virtual version of a physical resource (server, storage, network)
- A **hypervisor** breaks the dependency of an OS on the underlying hardware, allowing multiple VMs to share one physical host
- **KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine)** is one well-known hypervisor

#### Benefits over physical servers

| Benefit            | Detail                          |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| Faster deployment  | New servers provisioned quickly |
| Less waste         | Fewer idle machines             |
| Better portability | VMs can be imaged and moved     |

#### Remaining problems with VMs

- App + all dependencies + full OS are still bundled together
- Moving a VM between hypervisor products is not easy
- Each VM boot requires a full OS start-up
- **Multiple apps sharing one VM are not isolated:**
  - One app's resource use can starve others
  - A dependency upgrade for one app can break another
- Running a **dedicated VM per app** solves isolation but duplicates full kernels — doesn't scale to hundreds or thousands of apps

---

### Era 3 — Containers

> "Virtualize at the level of the application and its dependencies, not the entire machine."

- Only the **user space** is virtualized (all code above the kernel: apps + their dependencies)
- The kernel is shared — no need to boot a full OS per app

---

## What Is a Container?

> **Containers are isolated user spaces for running application code.**

- **Lightweight** — do not carry a full OS
- **Efficient** — scheduled and integrated tightly with the underlying system
- **Fast** — start/stop by creating/destroying OS processes, not booting VMs

---

## Why Containers Appeal to Developers

| Benefit                          | Detail                                                                                           |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Code-centric delivery**        | High-performing, scalable apps without infrastructure complexity                                 |
| **Reliable, consistent runtime** | Linux kernel base means code runs the same locally and in production                             |
| **Fast incremental updates**     | Changes to a container built on a production image deploy with a single file copy                |
| **Microservices-friendly**       | Loosely coupled, fine-grained components; OS can scale/upgrade parts without affecting the whole |

## Key Concept: User Space vs. Kernel Space

```
┌────────────────────────────────┐
│  User space                    │  ← containers live here
│  (apps + dependencies)         │
├────────────────────────────────┤
│  Linux Kernel                  │  ← shared by all containers on the host
├────────────────────────────────┤
│  Hardware                      │

### Think Like a Google Engineer
- Primary optimization axis: Elastic performance with minimum operational toil.
- Start with constraints first: SLO, security, compliance, latency, budget, and team operations capacity.
- Prefer managed services if they satisfy requirements with lower long-term operational toil.
- Minimize blast radius using environment isolation, least privilege, and failure-domain awareness.
- Design for day-2 operations: observability, rollback strategy, and quota or budget guardrails.

### Most Correct Option Filter (60 Seconds)
1. Eliminate options with broad access, single points of failure, or missing monitoring.
2. Confirm the option meets non-negotiables first: security and reliability requirements.
3. Compare remaining options on operational simplicity and long-term maintainability.
4. Use cost as an optimizer only after requirements and risk controls are satisfied.

### Weighted Decision Matrix
| Dimension | Weight | Strong Signal |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Security | 3 | Least privilege, secure defaults, no exposed blast radius |
| Reliability | 3 | Multi-zone or HA design, health checks, tested recovery path |
| Operability | 2 | Clear monitoring, alerting, rollout and rollback simplicity |
| Cost Efficiency | 2 | Right-sized resources, no waste, no reliability regression |
| Performance | 1 | Meets latency and throughput targets with headroom |

### Real-Life Scenario
A media startup has unpredictable traffic spikes during launches. They need faster releases, automatic scaling, and strong reliability without overpaying for idle capacity.

### Worked Example
- Choose managed compute first when operations overhead is a concern.
- For VM workloads, use managed instance groups with autoscaling and autohealing.
- For container workloads, use GKE node pools and rolling updates.
- For event-driven workloads, prefer Cloud Run or functions with concurrency controls.
