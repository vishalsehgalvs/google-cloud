# Cloud Monitoring Lab Walkthrough

## Lab Overview

- Verify VMs created by Deployment Manager
- Set up a Cloud Monitoring workspace
- Create a dashboard with a chart
- Create an alerting policy with multiple conditions
- Create a resource group
- Create an uptime check

---

## Task 1 — Verify VM Instances

- Navigate to **Compute Engine** → confirm 3 nginx VMs were pre-created via Deployment Manager

---

## Task 2 — Set Up Monitoring Workspace

- Navigate to **Cloud Monitoring** → opens in a new tab
- Monitoring automatically sets up a workspace for your project
- Wait a few minutes — you'll be redirected to the **Monitoring Overview** page once ready

---

## Task 3 — Create a Dashboard and Chart

1. **Monitoring → Dashboards → Create Dashboard**
2. Name: `My Dashboard` → press Enter
3. Click **Add Chart**:
   - Title: `My Chart`
   - Resource type: `GCE VM Instance`
   - Metric: `CPU Utilization`
   - Filters: none (to see all instances)
   - View Options: select **X-Ray mode**
   - Click **Save**

### Metrics Explorer (no dashboard required)

- **Monitoring → Resources → Metrics Explorer**
- Search any metric (e.g. `CPU Utilization`) to explore without creating a chart

---

## Task 4 — Create an Alerting Policy with Multiple Conditions

1. **Monitoring → Alerting → Create Policy**
2. **Add first condition:**
   - Resource: `GCE VM Instance`
   - Metric: `CPU Usage`
   - Condition: `is above`
   - Threshold: `20`
   - Duration: `1 minute`
   - Click **Save**
3. **Add second condition:**
   - Different metric (e.g. `Reserved Cores`)
   - Condition: `is above 15`
   - Click **Save**
4. **Policy trigger:** set to **"All conditions are met"**
5. **Notifications:**
   - Add channel: **Email** → enter email address → **Add**
6. **Documentation** (best practice): describe what happened, why the alert fired, and how to fix it — makes alerts actionable
7. Name the policy: `My First Alerting Policy` → click **Save**

---

## Task 5 — Create a Resource Group

1. **Monitoring → Groups → Create Group**
2. Name: `VM Instances`
3. Criteria: **Name contains** `nginx`
4. Click **Save Group**

> All 3 nginx VMs appear in the group because their names match the filter.

---

## Task 6 — Create an Uptime Check

1. **Monitoring → Uptime Checks → Create Uptime Check**
2. Title: `My First Uptime Check`
3. Protocol: `HTTP`
4. Applies to: **Group** → select `VM Instances`
5. Check interval: **every 1 minute**
6. Click **Save** (skip creating an alert policy for now)

---

## Lab Summary

| Task              | What was done                                                   |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Workspace setup   | Auto-created by Cloud Monitoring for your project               |
| Dashboard + chart | CPU utilization chart with X-Ray mode                           |
| Alerting policy   | Two conditions (CPU usage + reserved cores); email notification |
| Resource group    | Grouped all nginx VMs by name filter                            |
| Uptime check      | HTTP check on VM group every 1 minute                           |

## ACE Exam-Style Practice Questions

### Q1
A Cloud Monitoring Lab Walkthrough requirement asks to collect logs from all current and future production projects only. What should you do?

A. Configure manual exports in each project every month
B. Configure aggregated log sink at production folder level
C. Disable Cloud Logging and use VM files
D. Send logs to Cloud DNS

Answer: B
Trap: Folder-level aggregated sinks capture both existing and future child projects.

### Q2
In a Cloud Monitoring Lab Walkthrough incident, only a few requests are slow across many microservices. Which tool is best to identify the slow hop?

A. Cloud Trace
B. Cloud Storage lifecycle
C. Cloud Build trigger
D. Cloud Armor policy

Answer: A
Trap: Distributed tracing is designed for per-hop latency diagnosis.
