# Infrastructure Automation — Module Intro

## The Problem with Raw API Calls

- Calling the Cloud API from code is powerful but has maintainability challenges
- A program could have dozens of locations that call the API to create VMs — tracking down which call created a specific resource is difficult
- Applications change rapidly, requiring constant code maintenance
- Infrastructure quality becomes directly tied to code quality

---

## What Terraform Solves

- Uses **highly structured templates and configuration files** to define infrastructure in a readable, understandable format
- **Conceals the underlying Cloud API calls** — you focus on defining what you want, not how to call the API
- Infrastructure is documented as code, making it easy to review, version, and maintain

---

## What This Module Covers

- How to use **Terraform** to automate infrastructure deployment
- How to use **Google Cloud Marketplace** to launch infrastructure solutions
- Lab: use Terraform to deploy a **VPC network, firewall rule, and VM instances**

### Think Like a Google Engineer
- Primary optimization axis: Managed-service-first design with reliability and security by default.
- Start with constraints first: SLO, security, compliance, latency, budget, and team operations capacity.
- Prefer managed services if they satisfy requirements with lower long-term operational toil.
- Minimize blast radius using environment isolation, least privilege, and failure-domain awareness.
- Design for day-2 operations: observability, rollback strategy, and quota or budget guardrails.

### Most Correct Option Filter (60 Seconds)
1. Eliminate options with broad access, single points of failure, or missing monitoring.
2. Confirm the option meets non-negotiables first: security and reliability requirements.
3. Compare remaining options on operational simplicity and long-term maintainability.
4. Use cost as an optimizer only after requirements and risk controls are satisfied.

### Weighted Decision Matrix
| Dimension | Weight | Strong Signal |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Security | 3 | Least privilege, secure defaults, no exposed blast radius |
| Reliability | 3 | Multi-zone or HA design, health checks, tested recovery path |
| Operability | 2 | Clear monitoring, alerting, rollout and rollback simplicity |
| Cost Efficiency | 2 | Right-sized resources, no waste, no reliability regression |
| Performance | 1 | Meets latency and throughput targets with headroom |

### Real-Life Scenario
A growing startup is moving from manual infrastructure to Google Cloud. They need fast delivery, better reliability, and clear operational controls while keeping architecture simple.

### Worked Example
- Translate business goals into technical constraints before selecting services.
- Favor managed services to reduce operational burden where possible.
- Apply least-privilege IAM and private-by-default networking decisions.
- Add monitoring, logging, and budget controls from the start.
