# Load Balancing and Autoscaling — Module Intro

## Cloud Load Balancing Overview

- Distribute load-balanced compute resources across **single or multiple regions**
- All resources sit behind a **single anycast IP address**
- Scales up or down with **intelligent autoscaling**
- Can serve content as close as possible to users — handles **1 million+ queries per second**
- Fully **distributed, software-defined, managed service** — no physical load balancing infrastructure to manage

## Two Primary Load Balancer Types

| Type                          | OSI Layer             | Best For                                                  | Key Features                                                                |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Application Load Balancer** | Layer 7 (Application) | HTTP(S) traffic requiring content-based routing           | SSL/TLS termination, session affinity, routing by headers/cookies/URL paths |
| **Network Load Balancer**     | Layer 4 (Network)     | TCP/UDP traffic requiring low latency and high throughput | TCP/UDP load balancing, health checks, IP/port-based routing                |

## ACE Exam-Style Practice Questions

### Q1

Your internet-facing app needs URL path-based routing with managed TLS in a load balancing and autoscaling design. Which option is best?

A. External Application Load Balancer
B. Internal passthrough load balancer
C. Cloud NAT
D. Direct VM IP without load balancing

Answer: A
Trap: Host and path routing are Layer 7 capabilities provided by Application Load Balancing.

### Q2

Your managed instance group is at max replicas and each instance shows sustained 100% CPU during a traffic surge. What is the fastest first mitigation?

A. Change autoscaling metric to memory immediately
B. Increase the autoscaler upper limit, then investigate bottlenecks
C. Disable health checks
D. Restart all VMs manually

Answer: B
Trap: If autoscaling has hit the ceiling, raising max replicas is the quickest way to regain headroom.

### Think Like a Google Engineer
- Primary optimization axis: Latency-resilience balance with private-by-default connectivity.
- Start with constraints first: SLO, security, compliance, latency, budget, and team operations capacity.
- Prefer managed services if they satisfy requirements with lower long-term operational toil.
- Minimize blast radius using environment isolation, least privilege, and failure-domain awareness.
- Design for day-2 operations: observability, rollback strategy, and quota or budget guardrails.

### Most Correct Option Filter (60 Seconds)
1. Eliminate options with broad access, single points of failure, or missing monitoring.
2. Confirm the option meets non-negotiables first: security and reliability requirements.
3. Compare remaining options on operational simplicity and long-term maintainability.
4. Use cost as an optimizer only after requirements and risk controls are satisfied.

### Weighted Decision Matrix
| Dimension | Weight | Strong Signal |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Security | 3 | Least privilege, secure defaults, no exposed blast radius |
| Reliability | 3 | Multi-zone or HA design, health checks, tested recovery path |
| Operability | 2 | Clear monitoring, alerting, rollout and rollback simplicity |
| Cost Efficiency | 2 | Right-sized resources, no waste, no reliability regression |
| Performance | 1 | Meets latency and throughput targets with headroom |

### Real-Life Scenario
An ecommerce platform serves customers across regions. The team must keep latency low, protect internal services, and survive zonal failures while controlling egress costs.

### Worked Example
- Place internet-facing services behind the correct external load balancer type.
- Keep internal services private with internal load balancers and private IP ranges.
- Use firewall rules by tags or service accounts, not wide open CIDR ranges.
- Add Cloud CDN or regional placement based on traffic profile and content type.
