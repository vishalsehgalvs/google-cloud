# 🧪 Lab: Internal vs External IPs on a VM

## Lab Goal

This lab demonstrates three key behaviors in Google Cloud:

- Every VM needs an internal IP address
- External IP addresses are optional
- Ephemeral external IPs can change after stop/start

---

## Step 1: Create a VM and Open Networking Options

From **Compute Engine > VM instances**:

1. Click **Create Instance**
2. Expand **Management, security, networking, sole tenancy**
3. Open the **Networking** section
4. Edit the network interface (pencil icon)

This is where you choose internal and external IP behavior.

---

## Step 2: Choose Internal and External IP Settings

Inside the network interface settings, you can select:

- VPC network/subnet
- Internal IP option
- External IP option

### Internal IP options

You can use:

- **Ephemeral internal IP** (auto-assigned)
- **Custom internal IP** (manually choose within subnet range)
- **Reserved static internal IP** (keep the same internal IP long-term)

### External IP options

You can use:

- **Ephemeral external IP**
- **Reserved static external IP**
- **None** (no external access)

Important: External IP is optional. Internal IP is not.

---

## Step 3: Instance and Address Capacity Notes

In the walkthrough example, subnet size is **/20**, which gives a large address pool (roughly 4096 addresses).

But address range size is not the only limit. Also consider:

- Project/network quotas
- VM-per-network limits (example mentioned around 15,000 at recording time)
- Actual regional/zonal hardware capacity

So having IP space does not always guarantee unlimited VM creation.

---

## Step 4: Create the VM and Observe IPs

After creation, note both values in the VM list/details:

- Internal IP
- External IP

Expected behavior:

- Internal IP is from your subnet range
- External ephemeral IP is from Google's public pool

---

## Step 5: Stop the VM and Watch IP Changes

1. Select VM
2. Click **Stop**
3. Confirm stop action

During stop:

- Google Cloud allows time for graceful shutdown (for example, shutdown scripts)
- If scripts exceed timeout, a forced stop can occur

After VM is stopped:

- External ephemeral IP is released
- Internal IP usually remains associated with the VM

---

## Step 6: Start the VM Again

1. Click **Start**
2. Wait for instance to return to Running
3. Compare old vs new IP values

Typical result in this scenario:

- Internal IP stayed the same
- External IP changed (because it was ephemeral)

---

## What This Lab Proves

- Internal IP addresses are required for VM networking
- External IP addresses are optional for internet-facing access
- Ephemeral external IPs are not guaranteed to persist across stop/start
- If you need a stable public endpoint, reserve and attach a static external IP

---

## Key Takeaway

When designing VM connectivity:

- Use internal IPs for private communication
- Add external IP only when required
- Use static external IP for stable DNS/integration endpoints
- Expect ephemeral external IP to change after VM lifecycle events like stop/start

---

## gcloud Commands

```bash
# Create a VM with no external IP
gcloud compute instances create my-vm --zone=us-central1-a \
  --network-interface=no-address

# Assign a static external IP to a running VM
gcloud compute instances add-access-config my-vm --zone=us-central1-a \
  --access-config-name="External NAT" --address=STATIC_IP

# View a VM's IP addresses
gcloud compute instances describe my-vm --zone=us-central1-a \
  --format="get(networkInterfaces)"
```

## ACE Exam-Style Practice Questions

### Q1
A Vm Internal External Ip Lab workload requires full OS control and custom runtime with strict policy against managed platforms. Which compute option is best?

A. Compute Engine
B. Cloud Run Functions
C. App Engine Standard
D. Dataflow

Answer: A
Trap: Full host-level control is a strong Compute Engine signal.

### Q2
In a Vm Internal External Ip Lab scenario, a fault-tolerant nightly batch workload is too expensive. What should you test and then use?

A. Spot or preemptible VMs after simulated interruption testing
B. Owner role on all instances
C. Single large sole-tenant node
D. Cloud DNS autoscaling

Answer: A
Trap: Interruptible workloads are classic candidates for discounted VM pricing models.

### Think Like a Google Engineer
- Primary optimization axis: Latency-resilience balance with private-by-default connectivity.
- Start with constraints first: SLO, security, compliance, latency, budget, and team operations capacity.
- Prefer managed services if they satisfy requirements with lower long-term operational toil.
- Minimize blast radius using environment isolation, least privilege, and failure-domain awareness.
- Design for day-2 operations: observability, rollback strategy, and quota or budget guardrails.

### Most Correct Option Filter (60 Seconds)
1. Eliminate options with broad access, single points of failure, or missing monitoring.
2. Confirm the option meets non-negotiables first: security and reliability requirements.
3. Compare remaining options on operational simplicity and long-term maintainability.
4. Use cost as an optimizer only after requirements and risk controls are satisfied.

### Weighted Decision Matrix
| Dimension | Weight | Strong Signal |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Security | 3 | Least privilege, secure defaults, no exposed blast radius |
| Reliability | 3 | Multi-zone or HA design, health checks, tested recovery path |
| Operability | 2 | Clear monitoring, alerting, rollout and rollback simplicity |
| Cost Efficiency | 2 | Right-sized resources, no waste, no reliability regression |
| Performance | 1 | Meets latency and throughput targets with headroom |

### Real-Life Scenario
An ecommerce platform serves customers across regions. The team must keep latency low, protect internal services, and survive zonal failures while controlling egress costs.

### Worked Example
- Place internet-facing services behind the correct external load balancer type.
- Keep internal services private with internal load balancers and private IP ranges.
- Use firewall rules by tags or service accounts, not wide open CIDR ranges.
- Add Cloud CDN or regional placement based on traffic profile and content type.
