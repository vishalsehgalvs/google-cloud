You might start with one connectivity service and migrate to another as requirements change or new colocation facilities open. Choose based on bandwidth needs, encryption requirements, proximity to Google PoPs or colocation facilities, and whether you need internal or public IP access.

## ACE Exam-Style Practice Questions

### Q1
For Hybrid Connectivity Module Summary, you need highly available hybrid connectivity with dynamic route exchange. What should you choose?

A. HA VPN with Cloud Router
B. Static routes only over one tunnel
C. Cloud NAT only
D. Cloud CDN

Answer: A
Trap: Dynamic routing and high availability requirements usually indicate HA VPN plus BGP.

### Think Like a Google Engineer
- Primary optimization axis: Latency-resilience balance with private-by-default connectivity.
- Start with constraints first: SLO, security, compliance, latency, budget, and team operations capacity.
- Prefer managed services if they satisfy requirements with lower long-term operational toil.
- Minimize blast radius using environment isolation, least privilege, and failure-domain awareness.
- Design for day-2 operations: observability, rollback strategy, and quota or budget guardrails.

### Most Correct Option Filter (60 Seconds)
1. Eliminate options with broad access, single points of failure, or missing monitoring.
2. Confirm the option meets non-negotiables first: security and reliability requirements.
3. Compare remaining options on operational simplicity and long-term maintainability.
4. Use cost as an optimizer only after requirements and risk controls are satisfied.

### Weighted Decision Matrix
| Dimension | Weight | Strong Signal |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Security | 3 | Least privilege, secure defaults, no exposed blast radius |
| Reliability | 3 | Multi-zone or HA design, health checks, tested recovery path |
| Operability | 2 | Clear monitoring, alerting, rollout and rollback simplicity |
| Cost Efficiency | 2 | Right-sized resources, no waste, no reliability regression |
| Performance | 1 | Meets latency and throughput targets with headroom |

### Real-Life Scenario
An ecommerce platform serves customers across regions. The team must keep latency low, protect internal services, and survive zonal failures while controlling egress costs.

### Worked Example
- Place internet-facing services behind the correct external load balancer type.
- Keep internal services private with internal load balancers and private IP ranges.
- Use firewall rules by tags or service accounts, not wide open CIDR ranges.
- Add Cloud CDN or regional placement based on traffic profile and content type.
