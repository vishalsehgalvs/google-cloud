# Compute Engine: Images

## What a Boot Disk Image Contains

When creating a VM, you choose a **boot disk image**. It includes:

- Boot loader
- Operating system
- File system structure
- Pre-configured software
- Any other customizations

---

## Public Images

- Available for both **Linux** and **Windows**.
- Some are **premium images** (marked with a `p`):
  - Charged **per second** after a 1-minute minimum.
  - Exception: **SQL Server images** are charged **per minute** after a 10-minute minimum.
  - Premium image prices vary with **machine type** but are **global** — they do not vary by region or zone.

---

## Custom Images

- Create a custom image by pre-installing software authorized for your organization.
- Can be **imported** from:
  - On-premises or a local workstation
  - Another cloud provider
- Importing is a **no-cost service** — just install an agent.
- Custom images can be **shared** within the same project or across other projects.

---

## Machine Images

- A **machine image** is a Compute Engine resource that stores all of the following from one or more disks:
  - Configuration
  - Metadata
  - Permissions
  - Data
- Used to create a full VM instance from a saved state.
- Ideal for:
  - **Disk backups**
  - **Instance cloning and replication**
  - System maintenance scenarios (creation, backup and recovery)

---

## gcloud Commands

```bash
# List available public images
gcloud compute images list

# Create a custom image from a disk
gcloud compute images create my-image \
  --source-disk=my-disk --source-disk-zone=us-central1-a

# Create a machine image from a running VM
gcloud compute machine-images create my-machine-image \
  --source-instance=my-vm --source-instance-zone=us-central1-a

# Delete a custom image
gcloud compute images delete my-image
```

## ACE Exam-Style Practice Questions

A. Compute Engine
B. Cloud Run Functions
C. App Engine Standard
D. Dataflow

Answer: A
Trap: Full host-level control is a strong Compute Engine signal.

### Think Like a Google Engineer
- Primary optimization axis: Elastic performance with minimum operational toil.
- Start with constraints first: SLO, security, compliance, latency, budget, and team operations capacity.
- Prefer managed services if they satisfy requirements with lower long-term operational toil.
- Minimize blast radius using environment isolation, least privilege, and failure-domain awareness.
- Design for day-2 operations: observability, rollback strategy, and quota or budget guardrails.

### Most Correct Option Filter (60 Seconds)
1. Eliminate options with broad access, single points of failure, or missing monitoring.
2. Confirm the option meets non-negotiables first: security and reliability requirements.
3. Compare remaining options on operational simplicity and long-term maintainability.
4. Use cost as an optimizer only after requirements and risk controls are satisfied.

### Weighted Decision Matrix
| Dimension | Weight | Strong Signal |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Security | 3 | Least privilege, secure defaults, no exposed blast radius |
| Reliability | 3 | Multi-zone or HA design, health checks, tested recovery path |
| Operability | 2 | Clear monitoring, alerting, rollout and rollback simplicity |
| Cost Efficiency | 2 | Right-sized resources, no waste, no reliability regression |
| Performance | 1 | Meets latency and throughput targets with headroom |

### Real-Life Scenario
A media startup has unpredictable traffic spikes during launches. They need faster releases, automatic scaling, and strong reliability without overpaying for idle capacity.

### Worked Example
- Choose managed compute first when operations overhead is a concern.
- For VM workloads, use managed instance groups with autoscaling and autohealing.
- For container workloads, use GKE node pools and rolling updates.
- For event-driven workloads, prefer Cloud Run or functions with concurrency controls.
