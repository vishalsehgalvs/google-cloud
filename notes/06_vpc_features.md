# 🔧 VPC Features

## Routing Tables

- VPCs have **built-in routing tables** — no router to provision or manage.
- Used to forward traffic:
  - Between instances on the **same network**
  - Across **subnetworks**
  - Between **Google Cloud zones**
- No external IP address needed for any of this.

---

## Firewall

- VPCs include a **global distributed firewall** — no setup required.
- Controls both **incoming (ingress)** and **outgoing (egress)** traffic.

### Network Tags

A convenient way to apply firewall rules without tracking IP addresses:

1. Tag your VMs (e.g. tag all web servers with `"WEB"`)
2. Write a firewall rule targeting that tag (e.g. allow traffic on ports 80 and 443 to any VM tagged `"WEB"`)
3. The rule applies to those VMs regardless of their IP address.

## Connecting VPCs Across Projects

VPCs belong to a Google Cloud project — but sometimes VPCs in different projects need to talk to each other.

### Option 1: VPC Network Peering

Allows **private connectivity** between two VPC networks regardless of whether they belong to the same project or the same organization. Traffic stays on Google's private network — no public IPs or VPNs needed.

#### When to use it

- Your organization has **multiple network administrative domains**
- You want to **peer with another organization** (e.g. offer SaaS services privately, or connect networks after a merger/acquisition)

#### Advantages over external IPs / VPNs

| Benefit             | Detail                                                                            |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Lower latency**   | Private networking is faster than routing over public IPs                         |
| **Better security** | Services are never exposed to the public internet                                 |
| **Lower cost**      | Peered networks use internal IPs, saving on Google Cloud egress bandwidth charges |

> Regular network pricing still applies to all traffic — only the egress bandwidth savings are specific to peering.

#### How it works

- Both sides must **each create a peering connection** pointing at the other network — it is not one-sided
- Works across projects and across organizations

### Option 2: Shared VPC

- Uses full **IAM controls** to manage who and what in one project can interact with a VPC in another.
- More control than peering — lets you define fine-grained access policies.

# Create a firewall rule targeting a network tag
gcloud compute firewall-rules create allow-http \
  --network=my-vpc --allow=tcp:80 --target-tags=web-server

# Delete a firewall rule
gcloud compute firewall-rules delete allow-http

# Create VPC peering

## ACE Exam-Style Practice Questions

### Q1
In a Vpc Features architecture with autoscaling tiers, traffic must flow web to API to database only. How should you enforce this?

A. Separate projects without firewall policy
B. Tags or service-account-based firewall rules between tiers
C. DNS records only
D. Disable internal communication

Answer: B
Trap: Layered firewall policy with identity or tags is robust against autoscaling IP changes.

### Q2
A private VM in Vpc Features needs outbound internet updates but no inbound internet. What should you configure?

A. External IP on each VM
B. Cloud NAT
C. Cloud Armor only
D. Internal TCP load balancer

Answer: B
Trap: Cloud NAT handles outbound internet for private instances without exposing inbound services.

### Think Like a Google Engineer
- Primary optimization axis: Latency-resilience balance with private-by-default connectivity.
- Start with constraints first: SLO, security, compliance, latency, budget, and team operations capacity.
- Prefer managed services if they satisfy requirements with lower long-term operational toil.
- Minimize blast radius using environment isolation, least privilege, and failure-domain awareness.
- Design for day-2 operations: observability, rollback strategy, and quota or budget guardrails.

### Most Correct Option Filter (60 Seconds)
1. Eliminate options with broad access, single points of failure, or missing monitoring.
2. Confirm the option meets non-negotiables first: security and reliability requirements.
3. Compare remaining options on operational simplicity and long-term maintainability.
4. Use cost as an optimizer only after requirements and risk controls are satisfied.

### Weighted Decision Matrix
| Dimension | Weight | Strong Signal |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Security | 3 | Least privilege, secure defaults, no exposed blast radius |
| Reliability | 3 | Multi-zone or HA design, health checks, tested recovery path |
| Operability | 2 | Clear monitoring, alerting, rollout and rollback simplicity |
| Cost Efficiency | 2 | Right-sized resources, no waste, no reliability regression |
| Performance | 1 | Meets latency and throughput targets with headroom |

### Real-Life Scenario
An ecommerce platform serves customers across regions. The team must keep latency low, protect internal services, and survive zonal failures while controlling egress costs.

### Worked Example
- Place internet-facing services behind the correct external load balancer type.
- Keep internal services private with internal load balancers and private IP ranges.
- Use firewall rules by tags or service accounts, not wide open CIDR ranges.
- Add Cloud CDN or regional placement based on traffic profile and content type.
